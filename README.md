## ✨ Introduction

Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java that simplifies interactions between Java applications and relational databases. This repository is aimed at beginners who are learning how to use Hibernate to handle database interactions with various mapping strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** 🟦: Core programming language for this project.
- **Hibernate** 🌱: ORM tool used to map Java objects to database tables.
- **MySQL** 🐬: Relational database management system.
- **Maven** 📦: Build and dependency management tool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/albab786/Mapping-Hibernate.git
    ```

2. **Import the project** into your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) as a Maven project.

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a MySQL database.
   - Update the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file with your database credentials.

4. **Run the project**:
   - Once set up, you can run the main class, and Hibernate will take care of the database interactions.

## 🗺️ Mapping Examples

### 1️⃣ One-to-One Mapping

This example shows how to map two entities that have a one-to-one relationship. For example, mapping a `User` entity to its `UserProfile`.

### 1️⃣➖🔢 One-to-Many Mapping

This example demonstrates mapping one entity to multiple entities. For instance, a `Course` can have multiple `Students` enrolled.

### 🔀 Many-to-Many Mapping

In this example, you'll learn how to set up a many-to-many relationship. For instance, a `Student` can be enrolled in multiple `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Make sure to configure the project by updating the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file with the correct database credentials. Here's an example configuration for MySQL:

```xml
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">your_username</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password">your_password</property>
        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect</property>
        <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
```
